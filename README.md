# College Media

**College Media** is a community-driven web platform designed to encourage seamless interaction between engineering students‚Äîespecially juniors and seniors‚Äîby reducing hesitation in asking questions, sharing resources, and starting discussions. The platform provides structured features to support students who may feel shy or uncertain in reaching out for help, particularly in offline academic settings.

This application aims to:
- Help juniors get academic and placement-related guidance from seniors.
- Support anonymous interactions, allowing students to ask questions without fear of judgment.
- Promote collaborative learning through discussions and easy resource sharing.

It‚Äôs ideal for students who:
- Hesitate to ask doubts openly in class or directly to seniors.
- Prefer anonymous academic help and peer-based learning.
- Want to share or find branch-specific study materials quickly.
